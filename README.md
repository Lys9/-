*This is a simple and basic script. Its functionality is to use your browser's console (F12) to send emotes to any streamer’s chat. Its purpose is to earn EXP without having to manually type and send messages all the time.*
*While in the console, type "allow pasting" so you can paste the script.*

*You can use it for anything—that depends on your imagination and creativity.*

*It’s important to note that this command uses the first emoji in your recently used row. To use a different emoji, you can first send the emoji you want to spam in the chat, and it will become the most recently used one and the script will then send that emoji.*
